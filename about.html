           <p><strong>Established Experience</strong></p>
            <p> 
                Service Center was established in January 2006 by Ravindra Bhore specialising in IT solutions,services and support.
                Over the years our core focus of providing enterprise class IT solutions to businesses locally and nationally has continued whilst our offering has grown to include software development and consultancy services to our many clients.
                Our skilled and experienced staff, supported by our purpose built Data Centre and robust state-of-the-art network, allows us to offer a “full circle” service to our clients across all our departments.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Committed to quality</strong></p>
            <p>
                We are committed to supplying, installing and supporting robust computer systems, servers, networks, site-to-site links and core Microsoft and Linux products alongside bespoke software solutions that are planned and developed using best practice methodologies to ensure the highest levels of quality. 
                Offering a premium, but cost effective service, we only install products and software which we have tried, tested and believe in. 
                Brands specified include Dell, Hewlett Packard, Sony, Watchguard, Symantec and Microsoft.

        <h3>Our Company</h3>
        <p>   
            Our primary concern is to provide a continuous level of service to our clients wherever practically possible. Major elements of providing this service included relocating to our own detached commercial premises and building our own Tier 3 Data Centre. In addition, we have installed a backup 3 phase diesel generator, so we can continue delivering all provided services in the event of power failure. This means whether we are supporting your IT or hosting your data, we are able to provide a continuous and consistent level of service.
